{"text": "GENIE : Aaaaahhhhh!  OY!  Ten-thousand years will give ya such a crick in the neck!  (He hangs ALADDIN on a nearby rock.  Then he pulls his head off and spins it around, yelling as he does so.  CARPET pulls a ALADDIN down.)  Whoa!  Does it feel good to be outta there! (GENIE uses the lamp end of himself as a microphone.) Nice to be back, ladies and gentlemen.  Hi, where ya from? (Sticks the mic in ALADDIN's face.)  What's your name?"}
{"text": "ALADDIN : Uh, Al--uh--Aladdin."}
{"text": "GENIE : (Says his name as if he's discovered something major) Aladdin! (A neon sign lights up with ALADDIN's name on it, circled by chase lights.  The sign changes to reflect the GENIE's upcoming line.) Hello, Aladdin.  Nice to have you on the show.  Can we call you 'Al?' Or maybe just 'Din?'  Or how bout 'Laddi?'  (GENIE disappears, then a dog wrapped in plaid jumps in.) Sounds like 'Here, boy! C'mon, Laddi!'"}
{"text": "ALADDIN : (Shaking his head) I must have hit my head harder than I thought."}
{"text": "GENIE : (Still a dog) Do you smoke?  Mind if I do? (Dog poofs into smoke, then back to the GENIE.  ABU screeches wildly.)  Oh, sorry Cheetah--hope I didn't singe the fur!  Hey, Rugman!  Haven't seen you in a few millennia!  Slap me some tassel!  Yo! Yeah! (CARPET flies over and high fives the GENIE. GENIE looks at ALADDIN.)  Say, you're a lot smaller than my last master. (Lifts his beer-gut.)  Either that or I'm gettin' bigger.  Look at me from the side--do I look different to you?"}
{"text": "ALADDIN : Wait a minute!  I'm--your master?"}
{"text": "GENIE : (Slaps a diploma in ALADDIN's hand and a mortarboard on his head.)  That's right!  He can be taught!! What would you wish of me, (as Arnold Schwarzenegger)  the ever impressive,(inside a cube) the long contained, (as a ventriloquist with a dummy) often imitated, (tosses the dummy aside) but never duplicated--  DUP. GENIES:    Duplicated, duplicated,  duplicated, duplicated,  duplicated,  duplicated, duplicated, duplicated, duplicated."}
{"text": "GENIE : (Says it like a ring announcer at a boxing match.) Genie!  Of!  The Lamp!  (Goes into Ed Sullivan)  Right here direct from the lamp, right here for your enjoyment wish fulfillment. Thank youuuuu!"}
{"text": "ALADDIN : Whoa!  Wish fulfillment?"}
{"text": "GENIE : Three wishes to be exact.  And ix-nay on the wishing for more wishes.  (Turns into a slot machine, arm pulls down and three GENIEs appear in the windows.)  That's it--three.  (Three GENIE caballeros come out of the slot.)  Uno, dos, tres."}
{"text": "ALADDIN : (To ABU) Now I know I'm dreaming."}
{"text": "GENIE : (Music for \"Friend Like Me\" begins) Master, I don't think you quite realize what you've got here! So why don't you just ruminate, whilst I illuminate the possibilities.  (GENIE lights up like a fluorescent light)  Well Ali Baba had them forty thieves Scheherazadie had a thousand tales But master you in luck 'cause up your sleeve You got a brand of magic never fails!
